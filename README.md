# Roku 

Roku is a small project I started to start learning Javascript. It's a Discord music bot with the following functionalities currently implemented:

- Playing from URL or text input (from YouTube)
- Queue support with skip, pause, stop, resume and status commands
- Volume control
- Custom Discord embeds

If for some reason you want to build and test the bot code on your own, edit the config.js file accordingly. 

The bot needs the following dependencies:

```
common-tags, discord.js, ffmpeg, ffmpeg-static, node-opus, simple-youtube-api, ytdl-core
```
